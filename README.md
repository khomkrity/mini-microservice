# mini-microservice
> Building a simple post-and-comment project using microservice concept

## Goals of this Project
1. Get a taste of a microservice architecture (async, event-based communication between services)
2. Build as much as possible from scratch
3. Get a basic understanding of how to communicate between front-end and back-end

## Disclaimer
> Do not use this project as a template for future microservices stuff

## Installation
> cd to each service to install dependencies and run
```
# install dependencies
npm install

# run
npm start

```
